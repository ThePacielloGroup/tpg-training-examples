# ReadMe

# Introduction
This repository holds examples for use in training delivered by The Paciello Group. The examples here are meant to show single concepts only and the examples may be good or may be bad. The 'good' examples may also be incomplete and may also make little sense when taken out of context.

# Use it
The full final version of all examples is found in the `dist` folder. If you plan on uploading the examples for use somewhere, that's where you want to go.

## Contributing
There are two ways to contribute to this project:

### Logging bugs and feature requests
Bugs, feature requests, and suggestions are always encouraged. Please ensure, however, that you understand that some examples are purposefully broken or incomplete, so please reserve bug reports to only those things that are real bugs.

### Contributing Code
View the CONTRIBUTING.md doc in the root of this repository to learn how to contribute new examples or improvements to existing examples.
